## Can you talk about wildcard routes and use-cases?

**Key points**

- Always place wildcard route last
- Matches any undefined URL
- `UseCase:` For handling page-not-found scenarios (if you wanted the user to be navigated to access-denied / page-not-found pages if not having proper access)

**Code Snippet:**

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  // Other routes...
  { path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent }
];
```
