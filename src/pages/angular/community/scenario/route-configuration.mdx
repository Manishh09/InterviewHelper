# Can you explain what do you understand by below route configuration?

Code Snippet:

```typescript

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },             // Route 1
  { path: 'products/:id', component: ProductComponent },  // Route 2
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full' },  // Route 3
  { path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }        // Route 4
];

```

Answer By Starting like this: This is an Angular routing configuration that defines how different URLs should be handled in an Angular application.

And elaborate each route definition:

**1.`{ path: 'home', component: HomeComponent }`**

- When user visits /home, the HomeComponent will be displayed
- For example: http://yourapp.com/home

**2. `{ path: 'products/:id', component: ProductComponent }`**

- This is a dynamic route with a parameter `:id`
- The `:id` is a placeholder that can be any value
- For example: `http://yourapp.com/products/1` or `http://yourapp.com/products/xyz`
- The `ProductComponent` can access this `ID` value in its code

**3. `{ path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full' }`**

- This handles the `empty` path (root URL)
- When someone visits just `http://yourapp.com`, they'll be redirected to `/home`
- `pathMatch: 'full'` means the `redirect` only happens for the exact `empty` path`

**4. `{ path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }`**

- This is a `wildcard` route that catches all URLs that don't match any other routes
- If someone visits a non-existent route, they'll see the `PageNotFoundComponent`
- The `**` means `"match anything"`
- This should always be the `last` route in the array
