title: What is the difference between RouterModule.forRoot() and forChild() ?
---


## Explain the difference between RouterModule.forRoot() and forChild()?
**Answer:**

`forRoot()`: 
* Used in the main app routing module
* Creates a singleton router service
* Contains global router configuration
* Used only once in the application

`forChild()`: 
* Used in feature modules
* Doesn't create new router service instance
* Registers additional routes
* Can be used multiple times
